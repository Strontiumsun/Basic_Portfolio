        Hey all. Scott Here! And boy do I love Madden 08. Here's a song I wrote about it!
    </p>
    <p>
        Madden 2003 and 04 you played for the lore
        doing things the series never did before
        Madden 97 turned into 11
        these games can cure all kinds of depression!
        Madden 25, what did we travel through time?
        Nah, it was pretty alright
        John Madden Football, now I've seen it all
        shows how the mighty just refuse to fall.

        Pick any game you want, you have my guarantee
        'cause there's a Madden just for ME!
    </p>
    <p>You know I hate to get political, but there's a Madden out there for everyone! Just ask the Madden
        3DS community. Those guys get it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Madden Overdrive? Not a nosedive. 
        EA Sports you continue to thrive
        What's their goal? Their honest intent?
        Providing players with a sense of pride and accomplishment
        Madden CD oh boy oh gee 
        Why can't these things start growing on trees?
        Madden 08 - it's Nirvana on a plate!
        - I don't like that one
        Well you're a f***ing disgrace.

        Pick any game you want, you have my guarantee
        'cause there's a Madden for me!

        Yeah I like this one!
